    <br>
    <br><br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">The Department of Computer Science offers both B.S. and B.A. degree programs and four combined major programs in cooperation with other departments: Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Computer Science and Economics, Computer Science and Mathematics, and Computer Science and Psychology. Each program not only provides a solid technical education in the core of computer science but also allows students to take a broad range of courses in other disciplines that are an essential part of a liberal arts education.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">Specifically, the Computer Science and combined major programs share a common core of five computer science courses. The first is CPSC 201, a survey that demonstrates the breadth and depth of the field to students who have taken the equivalent of an introductory programming course. The remaining core courses cover discrete mathematics (CPSC 202 or MATH 244), data structures (CPSC 223), systems programming and computer architecture (CPSC 323), and algorithm analysis and design (CPSC 365 or 366). Only one of CPSC 365 or 366 may be taken for major credit. Together these courses include the material that every major should know.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">The core courses are supplemented by electives (and, for a combined major, core courses in the other discipline) that offer great flexibility in tailoring a program to each student's interests. The capstone is the senior project (CPSC 490), through which students experience the challenges and rewards of original research under the guidance of a faculty adviser. Prospective majors are encouraged to discuss their programs with the director of undergraduate studies (DUS) as early as possible.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: serif; font-size-adjust: 1; color: darkslateblue; margin-left: 2em">Introductory Courses</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">The department offers a broad range of introductory courses to meet the needs of students with varying backgrounds and interests. Except for CPSC 200 and CPSC 201, none assumes previous knowledge of computers.</p>
    <ol style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">
        <li>CPSC 100 is taught jointly with Harvard University and teaches students majoring in any subject area how to program a computer and solve problems. No prior programming experience is required. Students with previous programming experience should consider taking CPSC 201 instead. This course satisfies the Quantitative Reasoning distributional requirement.</li>
        <li>CPSC 110 teaches programming for humanities and social sciences using the Python programming language. No prior programming experience is required. This course satisfies the Quantitative Reasoning distributional requirement.</li>
        <li>CPSC 112 teaches students majoring in any subject area how to program a computer and solve problems using the Java programming language. No prior programming experience is required. Students with previous programming experience should consider taking CPSC 201 instead. This course satisfies the Quantitative Reasoning distributional requirement.</li>
        <li>CPSC 134 provides an introduction to computer music, including musical representations for computing, automated music analysis and composition, interactive systems, and virtual instrument design.</li>
        <li>CPSC 150 explores how some of the key ideas in computer science have affected philosophy of mind, cognitivism, connectionism, and related areas. This humanities-style course requires a significant amount of reading and writing a paper, and satisfies the Writing and the Humanities and Arts distributional requirements.</li>
