# sample-college-website

This repository contains HTML files and a CSS file, which when run together on a website creation platform (I used Apache NetBeans IDE 12.5) would display a sample vesrion of a college website. I've used Yale University's logo and clubs with no intention of using it for commercial or industrial use. Feel free to use these html codes as you like.
