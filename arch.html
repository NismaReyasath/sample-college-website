    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">Architecture is a humanistic endeavor. The purpose of the undergraduate major is to include the study of architecture within a comprehensive liberal arts education, drawing from the broader academic and professional environment of the Yale School of Architecture. The curriculum includes work in design; in history, theory, and criticism of architecture; and in urbanism, and leads to a bachelor of arts degree with a major in Architecture. As a liberal arts major in Yale College, it is not an accredited professional degree program. For accredited professional degree programs, refer to the requirements of the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB).</p>    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: serif; font-size-adjust: 1; color: darkslateblue; margin-left: 2em">Requirements of the Major</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">Students majoring in Architecture are required to take fifteen course credits, including prerequisites and the senior requirement. Majors are expected to take the three prerequisites by the end of their sophomore year and to complete a core of four courses, for five course credits, by the end of their junior year. They must also base their studies in one of two areas of concentration: the Design concentration or the History, Theory, Criticism of Architecture, and Urbanism concentration. Majors are also required to complete three orientation sessions: advanced technology orientation, library orientation, and shop orientation. Within the concentrations, electives are categorized under four broad subject areas: history and theory of architecture and the city; urbanism and landscape; materials and design; and structures and computation.</p>
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify"><b>Design concentration: </b>â€‚The Design concentration explores the role of architecture in shaping the world around us. It introduces complex processes involved in solving spatial and programmatic problems. Creative work is grounded in the study of history and culture, and in the analysis of social conditions influencing architecture. Design studios provide a forum for production and discourse. Studio projects address issues of architectural form, space, composition, site, tectonics, and programs within broader humanistic ideals. </p>    
    <br>
    <p style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">For the Design concentration, the following additional courses are required:</p>
    <br>
    <ol style="margin-left: 2em; margin-right: 2em; text-align: justify">
        <li>A core of four courses: the studio courses ARCH 250 and 251 taken during the junior year after the student is accepted into the major; and the history of architecture surveys, ARCH 260 and 312, to be completed by the end of the junior year</li>
        <li>The senior requirement, ARCH 450 and 494.</li>
